## üîß Development

### Project Structure
```
src/msgraph_mcp_server/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ auth/                 # Authentication & credentials
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ resources/            # Resource modules (users, groups, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/               # Utilities (graph client, password generator)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server.py           # Main FastMCP server with all tools
```

### Adding New Features
1. Create new resource module in `resources/`
2. Add new MCP tools in `server.py`
3. Update README with new capabilities

### Testing
```bash
# Run tests (when available)
pytest

# Type checking
mypy src/

# Code formatting
black src/
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Considerations

### Credentials
- **Never commit secrets** to version control
- Use environment variables or secure vaults
- Rotate secrets regularly
- Use least privilege permissions

### Monitoring
- Monitor Azure AD audit logs for MCP server activities
- Set up alerts for sensitive operations (user creation/deletion)
- Review permission usage regularly

### Access Control
- Limit who has access to the MCP server credentials
- Consider implementing additional approval workflows for critical operations
- Use service accounts with limited scope when possible

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Authentication Failures
```
Error: Missing required credentials: client_secret
```
- Check that `config/.env` exists and contains all required values
- Verify the client secret hasn't expired

#### Permission Denied
```
Authorization_RequestDenied
```
- Verify all required API permissions are added
- Ensure admin consent has been granted
- Check that permissions are "Application" type, not "Delegated"

#### User Creation Fails
```
Error creating user: Property 'userPrincipalName' is invalid
```
- Ensure the UPN domain matches your tenant's verified domains
- Check that the user doesn't already exist

### Getting Help
1. Check the error logs for specific error messages
2. Verify your Azure AD app permissions
3. Test with a simple operation first (like `search_users`)
4. Check Microsoft Graph API documentation for specific requirements
